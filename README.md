# zkTalents

zkTalents is an innovative project that uses zero-knowledge proofs for job/resume verification. It provides a secure and privacy-focused platform where employers can set specific requirements for job positions while allowing candidates to prove their eligibility without revealing sensitive information.

With zkTalents, employers have the flexibility to define various criteria for job applications like modules. For instance, they can verify a candidate's GitHub pull requests, age, or even incorporate advanced modules like Gitcoin passport measurements for enhanced customization.

To explore the inner workings of zkTalents, you can check into the `contracts` directory, where you will find the contract implementation and the Oracle's functionality.
