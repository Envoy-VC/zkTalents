# What we learnt, and challenges working on zkTalent

zkTalent was a great learning experience for us. We learnt a lot about the zk-SNARKs and the underlying cryptography. we learnt how to work with mina protocol, building zkapps.

our idea of zkTalent was an application where we would make it possible for a recruiter to set role requirements and we use zk to verify that the candidate meets the requirements without revealing personal information about the candidate, and the candidate can also verify that the recruiter is legit without revealing personal information about the recruiter.

we had i mind creating modules for extra customizability, like gitcoin passport, proof of humanity, etc.  including Job/Resume verification.

we decided to use polybase for off-chain (still decentralized) storage.

however, we faced issues in the implementation of the project, we had issues with the implementing the ui to interact with mina protocol.
there were random errors like:

converted a string to publicKey
invalid Key etc.

generally, it was a great learning experience for us, and we hope to continue learning and building on the mina blockchain.
